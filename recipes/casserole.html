        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 pounds ground chuck</li>
        <li>2 cups finely chopped yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 cup finely chopped green bell pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups ketchup</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons yellow mustard</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 (8.5 ounce) packages corn muffin mix (such as JiffyÂ®)</li>
        <li>2/3 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly spray a 9x13-inch baking dish
            with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; add ground beef, and cook, stirring occasionally and breaking up
            meat into smaller pieces with a wooden spoon, until almost fully browned, about 4 minutes. Add onion and
            bell pepper, and cook over medium-high, stirring occasionally, until softened and tender, 6 to 8 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in tomato paste; cook, stirring constantly, until tomato paste has slightly darkened in color, about 2
            minutes. Stir in beef broth, using a spatula to scrape any browned bits from bottom of pan. Stir in ketchup,
            mustard, Worcestershire sauce, sugar, garlic powder, and black pepper until fully combined. Bring to a boil
            over medium-high, and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens and bubbles appear all over the
            surface, about 7 minutes. Remove from heat, and transfer to the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>Whisk together corn muffin mix, milk, baking powder, and eggs in a medium bowl until fully combined; spoon
            in an even layer over sloppy Joe filling.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cornbread is golden brown and a wooden pick inserted in the center comes
            out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
